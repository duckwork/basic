Vim colorscheme for GUI and 256 color terminals based on HTML default style

Compatible with gVim, vim and nvim in terminals with 256 colors.
Light background only.

It looks like this:

I wrote this because I accidentally hit the option in Windows to get rid of backgrounds for accessibility,
then found out I really like it.

There are hardly any highlights: Constants are marked navy, Identifiers are italic, and Statements are bold.
The Visual selection is yellow, and the Search text is cyan.
Diffs are darker cyan, yellow, and magenta (I got the idea from some blog post that's unsearchable
because "diff cyan yellow" finds a lot of pages on color theory).
